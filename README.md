# Personal-Assistant-AI
Played with some great python packages like speech_recognition , pyaudio and wolfram Alpha.&nbsp;   
I named it IRIS in Honour of my Cat which is not with me anymore.  
Take a look at the code and get your own Api keys for all the api's used, you can create an account and get the api keys&nbsp;  
Happy Learning!.&nbsp;
